ðŸ“Œ Sample Interview Questions & Answers

ðŸ”¹ Image Loading & Memory Management
Q1: What is bitmap pooling, and why is it important?
A: Bitmap pooling is a memory optimization technique where previously used bitmaps are reused instead of creating new ones. This reduces garbage collection pressure and improves app performance, especially in scrolling lists.

Q2: How does Coil/Glide handle memory management?
A:

Coil: Uses coroutines and OkHttp caching, making it lightweight and efficient.
Glide: Uses LruCache and bitmap pooling to optimize memory and speed.

Q3: How do you prevent OutOfMemory (OOM) errors while loading large images?
A:

Use image downsampling to load smaller images.
Use disk caching instead of loading from the network.
Use placeholders to prevent blank UI while loading.
Avoid keeping large bitmaps in memory unnecessarily.

Q4: Explain the difference between memory caching and disk caching in image loading.
A:

Memory Caching: Stores images in RAM for faster retrieval but consumes more memory.
Disk Caching: Stores images on disk, reducing memory usage but requiring more time to load.

ðŸ”¹ Security Best Practices
Q5: What is SSL Pinning, and how does it protect your app?
A:

SSL Pinning ensures that the app only trusts a predefined SSL certificate, preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. If an attacker tries to intercept network traffic using a fake certificate, the request will be rejected.

Q6: How do you securely store sensitive data in an Android app?
A:

Use EncryptedSharedPreferences for small key-value data.
Store cryptographic keys in Android KeyStore.
Use SQLCipher for encrypting SQLite databases.

Q7: What is OWASP Mobile Security and why is it important?
A:
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a standard for mobile security best practices. It helps developers secure apps from data leakage, insecure authentication, and cryptographic weaknesses.

Q8: How can you detect if an app is running on a rooted device?
A:
You can check for:

The presence of root management apps (SuperSU, Magisk)
Writable system partitions (/system/xbin/su existence)
Running shell commands like which su
Example code:

fun isDeviceRooted(): Boolean {
    val paths = arrayOf("/system/xbin/su", "/system/bin/su")
    return paths.any { File(it).exists() }
}

Q9: How do you protect an APK from reverse engineering?
A:

Enable ProGuard/R8 for obfuscation.
Use DexGuard for additional security.
Encrypt sensitive strings instead of hardcoding them in the APK.
Remove debug logs to prevent exposing sensitive data.

Q10: What is SQL Injection, and how can you prevent it in Android?
A:

SQL Injection occurs when an attacker manipulates SQL queries to access unauthorized data.
Prevention methods:

Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.
Use Room ORM, which handles security automatically.
Bad Practice (Vulnerable to SQL Injection):

val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'"

Best Practice (Safe with Parameterized Query):

@Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username")
fun getUser(username: String): User

ðŸ”¥ Bonus: Scenario-Based Questions
Q11: Your app loads a large number of images but experiences performance issues. How would you debug this? A:

Check for memory leaks using Android Studioâ€™s Profiler.
Use Coil's request logging to see if unnecessary image loads happen.
Optimize LazyColumn scrolling performance.
Reduce bitmap resolution using .size() in Coil/Glide.

Q12: A security audit found your app is vulnerable to MITM attacks. How would you fix it? A:

Implement SSL Pinning using OkHttp.
Enforce HTTPS (HSTS) for all network calls.
Use Network Security Configuration to block cleartext traffic.

ðŸš€ Conclusion
These are the most important interview topics and sample questions related to Image Loading & Memory Management and Security Best Practices. 
Mastering these will make you confident in handling performance issues and security vulnerabilities in Android apps.
