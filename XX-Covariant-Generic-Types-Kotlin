Can you explain this synatax of this sealed class created and what is all this <out T> ??? I am not understanding this

Great question! Let's break down the sealed class syntax and the <out T> part step by step.

Sealed Class Breakdown
The sealed class is used to define a restricted class hierarchy, meaning all subclasses must be declared in the same file. It's useful when you need to represent different states (like Success, Error, and Loading in a network call).

sealed class ApiResult<out T> { 
    data object Loading : ApiResult<Nothing>() 
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : ApiResult<T>()
    data class Error(val message: String, val throwable: Throwable? = null) : ApiResult<Nothing>()
}

Breaking Down Each Part
1️⃣ sealed class ApiResult<out T>
sealed class → This makes sure all subclasses (Success, Error, Loading) are part of this hierarchy.
<out T> → This is a generic type parameter, meaning the class can hold data of any type (e.g., String, List<User>, Int, etc.).
out → This makes T covariant, meaning we can use ApiResult<String> wherever ApiResult<Any> is expected.

✅ Example:

val result: ApiResult<String> = ApiResult.Success("Hello")
val anyResult: ApiResult<Any> = result  // ✅ Works because `out T` allows covariance
If out wasn’t there, this wouldn’t work.

2️⃣ data object Loading : ApiResult<Nothing>()
data object → Used when there are no properties (because Loading doesn't need any data).
Nothing → This means this type never produces a value.
Used when we don’t need to store any actual data.

✅ Example:

val loadingState: ApiResult<Int> = ApiResult.Loading  // Works for any type
3️⃣ data class Success<T>(val data: T) : ApiResult<T>()
This is a subclass of ApiResult that holds a successful response.
T → Generic type, meaning it can be String, List<User>, etc.

✅ Example:

val success: ApiResult<List<Int>> = ApiResult.Success(listOf(1, 2, 3))
4️⃣ data class Error(val message: String, val throwable: Throwable? = null) : ApiResult<Nothing>()
Represents an error state.
message: String → Error message.
throwable: Throwable? = null → Optional exception for debugging.
Nothing → This means the Error case never contains valid data.

✅ Example:

val errorState: ApiResult<String> = ApiResult.Error("Something went wrong")
Final Understanding: Why Use <out T>?
Covariance (out) allows flexibility
out T means T can only be used as an output (return type), not as an input (parameter).
We can use ApiResult<String> wherever ApiResult<Any> is expected.
We prevent accidental modifications to the internal state.

✅ Valid usage with out T

val stringResult: ApiResult<String> = ApiResult.Success("Hello")
val anyResult: ApiResult<Any> = stringResult  // ✅ Works because `out T` allows flexibility
❌ Invalid without out T

val stringResult: ApiResult<String> = ApiResult.Success("Hello")
val anyResult: ApiResult<Any> = stringResult  // ❌ Wouldn’t work without `out`

Summary
Component	Meaning
sealed class ApiResult<out T>	Defines a sealed class with a generic type T
<out T>	Makes T covariant (can be used as an output but not input)
data object Loading : ApiResult<Nothing>()	Represents the loading state (no data needed)
data class Success<T>(val data: T) : ApiResult<T>()	Holds successful response data
data class Error(val message: String, val throwable: Throwable? = null) : ApiResult<Nothing>()	Holds error message and exception
This structure is widely used in Android development for network response handling.
